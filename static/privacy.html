        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Last updated/reviewed: October 21, 2020</p>

        <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING A GENERATE SITE.</p>

        <br>

        <p>GENERATE SOFTWARE INC. and their affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “GENERATE”, “we” “our” and “us”) respect an individual's privacy and will only collect, use, store or disclose your personally identifiable information (“personal
          information”) in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We recognize every individual's right to privacy and acknowledge our obligation to preserve the confidentiality of personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to GENERATE and our
          collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information through our websites, online store, mobile applications, and events and other activities (collectively, the “Services”). GENERATE reserves the right to update this Privacy
          Policy at any time and such modifications shall be effective immediately. This Privacy Policy also explains how you can ask questions and make suggestions about our privacy practices and review and update your personal information.
        </p>We urge you to read this Privacy Policy carefully and to check back periodically as this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites which are
        not owned or controlled by GENERATE.<p>

        <h2>CONSENT</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When you provide GENERATE with your personal information, you understand and agree to our collection, use, storage, disclosure and retention of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.
          Except in limited circumstances, you may withdraw your consent to our use of your personal information at any time.</p>

        <h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT</h2>

        <p>To provide the Services, we collect two types of information about our users: personal information (information that can personally identify you such as your name, address, email address, birth date, location, gender, etc.) and
          non-personal information (information of an anonymous nature that cannot be used to identify or re-identify individuals). We limit our collection to what is needed for the purposes in this policy, or as otherwise stated or implied at the
          time of collection.
        <p>

        <p>The information we collect falls into three categories: (1) information we collect from you; (2) information we collect when you use our Services; and (3) information we collect from other sources.</p>

        <p>When you access our Services as a visitor, registered user or subscriber, we collect and use the personal information, non-personal information and other content, communications and other information you provide when using the Services.
          Your information is collected when you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Create or share content when using the Services</li>
          <li> Create or share content when using the Services</li>
          <li> Message or communicate with others </li>
          <li> Register for and access the Services through an account </li>
          <li> Download the mobile application</li>
          <li> Sign up for periodic news and other updates </li>
          <li> Participate in promotions, contests or events </li>
          <li> Make a purchase </li>
          <li> Provide information to us in relation to a service or technical issue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We collect information from you such as:</p>

        <li>Your name, email address, and other contact information</li>
        <li>Your age/date of birth, gender, and geographic location</li>
        <li>Your payment information </li>
        <li>Any other information you may provide</li>

        <p>We may also collect information about the Services you use and how you use them. We do this to ensure that we are offering you the best services in a secure environment, and as part of our efforts to constantly improve your experience. In
          this process, we may collect and use your personal information relating to your use of GENERATE Services, technical details about your browser and mobile device use and location (e.g., whether you are using a tablet or smartphone to visit
          our websites),your IP address, the metadata on content you provide, which can indicate things like the date a file was created, and your viewing and usage trends in order to analyze and offer you customized advertising, products and
          services.</p>

        <p>Some of the personal information we may collect, such as payment information, we consider to be sensitive information. </p>

        <p>Our web servers may also automatically collect non-personal information which is provided through your browser or stored on a cookie or other similar technologies when you access the Services. You can set your browser to refuse all or some
          browser cookies, or to alert you when websites access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our websites may become inaccessible or fail to function properly.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</h2>

        <p>We also collect information that is publicly available, to the extent permitted by applicable law. For example, we may collect information you submit to a blog, a chat room, or a social network like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Google+.
        </p>

        <h2>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>

        <p>We use your personal and non-personal information so that we can:</p>

          <li>Send you e-communications about offers, products, services and information about us and/or selected partners that we feel will be of interest to you, if you have indicated you want to receive such offers and information</li>
          <li>Perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behaviour of our users, to measure user demographics and interests, to describe our services to third parties such as prospective business partners and advertisers and
            to analyze how and where best to use our resources</li>
          <li>In the case of social logins, link your accounts for sign-in purposes, connect you with existing contacts and allow you to post directly from our websites to your other social accounts. We won’t post through your accounts without your
            permission</li>
          <li>To maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You are under no obligation to provide personal information, but your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain portions or features of our Services. </p>

        <h2>WHO SEES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p>Access to personal information within GENERATE will be restricted to those individuals who need the information in order to carry out their job duties. Those individuals are trained and instructed to maintain the information in the
          strictest of confidence and will not provide access to the information to anyone who is not authorized.</p>

        <p>All individuals we hire to conduct business on our behalf will be required to respect the provisions of this policy and our procedures. Violations of any part of the contractual agreement may result in termination of the contract.</p>

        <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT OR DISCLOSE TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>

        <p>We work with business partners to provide the Services. For example, we have partners that:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide payment software; and</li>
          <li>Give you the option to log in to our Services using credentials from your existing social accounts like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Google+</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our partners receive your data if you use their services through our Services, and it becomes subject to their privacy policies. </p>

        <p>When you interact with them through our Services, our partners may provide information to us such as:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>About your device</li>
          <li>How you use their services</li>
          <li>If you use social login, your account log in credentials, name, profile picture, and, if you give us permission, your likes, check-ins and friends list</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We require our partners to have the right to collect, use and share your data before providing any data to us.</p>

        <p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission. Instead,
          advertisers can tell us things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be interested. We may provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that help them understand
          how people are interacting with their content.</p>

        <p>Other users provide information when they use our websites. This can sometimes include information about you, such as when others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to you, or upload, sync or import your contact
          information.</p>

        <h2>MORE ABOUT CONSENT / MANAGING YOUR PREFERENCES</h2>

        <p>By using the Services or submitting information to us in connection with using the Services or our websites, you are providing your consent to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and retention of personal information as set out in
          this Privacy Policy. Consent may be withdrawn at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice; however, without such consent, we may limit the Services we are able to provide you.</p>

        <p>Wherever possible, we seek a person’s consent before we collect their personal information. The form of consent may vary depending on the circumstances and the type of information being requested. Consent can be express or implied and can
          be provided directly by the individual or by an authorized representative. Implied consent may be reasonably inferred from a person’s action or inaction. For example, providing a name and address to sign up for our newsletter, or a name and
          telephone number to receive a response to a question implies that we have your consent. When determining the appropriate form of consent, we take into account the sensitivity of the personal information, the reasons we are collecting it,
          and the reasonable expectations of the person. When using personal information for a new purpose, we will do our best to document that new purpose and ask for consent again.</p>

        <p>Our Privacy Officer will act as the main point of contact for individuals seeking information or who have concerns about our handling of their personal information. If you wish to withdraw your consent for the collection, use or disclosure
          of your personal information by GENERATE, please contact us any time at info@generateapp.com. Your withdrawal of consent can’t be retroactive, since we may already have used your information for the purposes described here, but it will be
          applied on a go-forward basis. </p>


        <h2>ANTI-SPAM</h2>

        <p>Where applicable, we will seek your express consent to contact you, including by way of commercial electronic messages. You can unsubscribe at any time from receiving commercial electronic messages by following the instructions in the
          electronic message you received or by emailing us at <a mailto:"info@generateapp.com">info@generateapp.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Even if you have opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, please be aware that we may still contact you for other purposes. For example, we may contact you regarding the products or services we provide to you, or if you
          contact us with an inquiry.</p>

        <h2>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

        <p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure that any personal information you provide is maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect
          your personal information, GENERATE cannot warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us or from our on-line services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personal
          information. You do so at your own risk. Consequently, GENERATE and any directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors or agents thereof do not represent, warrant or guarantee that your personal information will be
          protected against misuse, loss or modification, nor do such parties accept liability for the security of a user’s personal information submitted on or in connection with our websites.</p>

        <p>GENERATE has implemented and maintains reasonable and appropriate security measures, procedures and practices to protect against the loss and unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction or disclosure of your personal information
          while it is in our custody or under our control.</p>

        <p> We also limit access to your personal information to those employees, contractors and agents who have a business need to know.</p>

        <p>You can help protect the security of your personal information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access your account or registration information. Also remember to log out of your account and
          close your browser window when you finish using our websites or surfing the internet, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. </p>

        <h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES AND ADVERTISING</h2>

        <p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. While we try to link only to sites and services that share our standards for privacy, please understand that we are not responsible for the content of, or the privacy practices
          employed by other companies or websites. This privacy policy applies only to the websites that reference it.</p>

        <h2>RETENTION AND DESTRUCTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>


        <p>
          GENERATE retains personal information for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. When we no longer are required to retain the personal information, we will destroy, erase, or de-identify it. Legal requirements,
          however, may require us to retain some or all of the personal information we hold for a period of time that is longer than that for which we might otherwise hold.
          If you want to cancel or delete your account, you may do so in writing at the email or postal address provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We will make every effort to promptly respond to your request. We will retain your information
          for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services, such as product returns or warranties. If you ask us to delete your account, we generally retain and use your account information only as long as necessary to
          fulfill a business or law enforcement need.
        </p>

        <h2>ACCESS OR CORRECTIONS/CHANGES TO PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>


        <p>GENERATE provides you with the means to access, update, edit or delete any account or registration information you may have provided to us at any time on your own by going to the appropriate page in the account or registration section of
          the relevant Service, and changing or deleting such information as desired.</p>

        <p>If you are unsure whether we have a record containing any of your Personal Information and would like to confirm whether or not we do, please send an email to GENERATE indicating all email addresses and social accounts that you may have
          given us.</p>

        <p>Any such access request may be subject to a small statutory fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you, where permitted by applicable law.</p>

        <p>ou also have the right to formally request access or corrections to your personal information under the Personal Information Protection of Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”). GENERATE is required to direct individuals who request formal
          access or corrections to their personal information to our Privacy Officer. Once we receive a formal request under PIPEDA, our Privacy Officer will respond according to PIPEDA.</p>

        <p>If you decide at any time that you do not want to receive any email materials to which you have subscribed, you may choose to unsubscribe to these emails by following the instructions at the end of the message.</p>

          <li>We may share your information in a way that does not directly identify you. For example, we may combine information about you with information about other people and share the combined information in a way that does not link your
            information to you</li>

          and advertisers the overall aggregate demographics available regarding, for example who participated in a contest or who saw and “clicked” on an advertisement. No personal information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as
          part of this process, only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed in this manner.</p>

        <h2>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS</h2>

        <p>A “Cookie” is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred (through your browser) from a web site to the hard drive of your computer. The Cookie identifies your browser and will not let a web site know
          any personal information about you, such as your name and address. Since Cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information, or transmit any information to anyone.</p>

        <p>GENERATE may use Cookies to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Monitor website usage and improve the operation and performance of the Servic es and to make our Services easier and more convenient to use. For example, Cookies help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that we can
            offer and provide more personalized services (e.g. language preference). Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit a Service;</li>
          <li>Measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related to the Services and advertisements (e.g., number of users, average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information helps us to better understand when to
            update, change or offer new services and provides us with details as to the performance of third-party advertisements and content. This information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to our current and prospective sponsors,
            advertisers and</li> business partners. No Personal Information will be disclosed in such reports; and
          <li>Displaying advertisements. GENERATE and third-party advertising providers used by GENERATE may use Cookies when serving advertisements.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Cookies are used on many major web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a Cookie, or to refuse to accept Cookies. You should
          understand that while GENERATE does not require you to use Cookies, certain Services will not function properly if you set your browser to not accept Cookies.</p>

        <p>Certain Services may contain electronic images known as “Web Beacons”, sometimes called single-pixel gifs, that allow GENERATE to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web Beacons are not used to
