        </ul>
        <h1 id="one">1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
        <p>We collect the following types of information about you:<br>Information you provide us directly — We ask for certain information such as your name and e-mail address if you register for a User account with the Service, or if you correspond with us (in which case we will also retain our responses). If you purchase products or services or sign up for a paid subscription, then we will also ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you create, share, or post to the Service, which may include information contained in your profile as well as photos or other image files and associated metadata. If you sign up for our e-mail mailing list, we will collect your name and e-mail address. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
        <p>Information we may receive from third parties — We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Generate  application, linking your account to the Generate  Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Generate. This information could include, but is not limited to any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. We may use this information to find your contacts on the Service, to let you know what your contacts are doing on the Service, and to let your contacts know what you are doing on the Service. We may also use it to suggest additional users or friends you may want to follow or connect with. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Generate ’s websites or Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p>
        <p>Inviting a third party to use our Service — If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service, we will ask you for that person’s email address or phone number, or with your permission we may access and store your contact list available on your mobile device, and we will automatically send an email invitation to the invitee. After sending the invitation, we may also send reminder emails to your invitees on your behalf. We store this information to send this email, to register the invitee if your invitation is accepted, to track the success of our invitation service, and to let you know when your contacts join the Service. Unless the invitee becomes a registered User of the Service, we do not use the invitee’s email address for marketing purposes, and we do not share the invitee’s email address with third parties other than Generate ’s service providers. The invitee may contact us at any time to request that we remove his or her information from our database in this form.<br>Metadata — We may collect metadata associated with User Content. Metadata typically consists of how, when, where and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content has been formatted. Users can add or may have added metadata added to their User Content including keywords posted with a photo or video, including names, geographical or location information, comments or other data. This makes your data more searchable and more interactive. However, the metadata may be accessible to others if you share the User Content with others or on third party social media sites.</p>
        <p>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.<br>Use of cookies and other technology to collect information. We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website or use our Service.<br>Analytics information — We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including the web pages you visit, your browser add-ons, your browser’s width and height, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We may collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
        <p>Cookies information — When you visit the Service, we and our third party partners may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Generate  help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. You can find out more about our use of cookies and similar technologies in our Cookie Policy.<br>Log file information — Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.<br>Clear gifs/web beacons information — When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users anonymously. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
        <p>Device identifiers — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets) or computer, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Generate . A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
        <p>Location data — When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</p>

Typically, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use cookies and other tracking technology to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service and on other sites around the Web, to send you the ads that appear on the Service, to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. The Generate  Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. For more information about your choices regarding the use of your personal information for online advertising, please see our Cookie Policy.<br>We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including advertising; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (h) track User Content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; and (i) to provide advertising to your browser or device. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our visitors, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.</p>
