You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account password secure. You are not allowed to provide a third party access to your Account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your Account. You must notify Generate immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. Generate will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account. You may never use another User’s Account without permission.

By connecting your Third-Party Accounts you are allowing Generate to access your Third-Party Account as permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Generate and/or grant Generate access to your Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for the purposes described herein) without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account and without obligating Generate to pay any fees or making Generate subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers. By granting Generate access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Generate may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other materials accessible through the Services that you have provided to and stored in such Third-Party Account (“SNS Content”) so that it is available on and through the Services via your Account. Unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, all SNS Content shall be considered to be your User Content (as defined in Section 2.1) for all purposes of the Agreement. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose to connect to the Services and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your Account. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Generate’s access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by you or the third-party service provider, then your Account and SNS Content may no longer be available on and through the Services. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and your Third-Party Accounts by accessing the applicable account settings page on the Third-Party Account. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND GENERATE IS NOT LIABLE FOR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO IT BY SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY SETTINGS THAT YOU HAVE SET IN SUCH THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.

          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
          If you connect your Generate account to a third-party service, you agree to let Generate access the stuff in your third-party account in accordance with your settings on that service and use it to provide our services to you. Generate is not responsible for your use of any third-party services or for any of your stuff the third-party service shares with us.
          </p>
          <p>
          There are some ground rules you must abide by that are intended to protect our services and the Generate community. For example, you must not steal or attack our services or try to take other users’ personal information. Essentially, be reasonable and responsible. Do not engage in any activity that could be harmful to Generate, our services, or our users. When using our services, you are responsible for your interactions with others. Generate does not control, and is not responsible for, any user’s actions.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our services are always changing and evolving, and we may decide to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings. We can also suspend or terminate any individual account at any time for any reason.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>5. PAID SERVICES</h2>
        <p>
        5.1 Fees. Certain products or services offered on or through the Services may be provided for a fee or other charge, including services or features for which access and use is purchased on a time limited basis (each a “Subscription”). You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Our current pricing and payment terms are listed on the mobile application store or website of the authorized third party through which you have purchased a Subscription (“Distributor”). Generate may add new products and services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing products and services, at any time in its sole discretion. Any increased fees for existing Subscriptions will apply solely on a forward-looking basis beginning on your next billing period.

        <p>
        5.2 Payment. You may be required to provide Generate or the Distributor with information pertaining to a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us or Distributor), PayPal account, or other permitted payment method (“Payment Information”). You agree that Generate or the Distributor, as applicable, is authorized to immediately charge your Payment Information for all fees and charges due and payable for the products and services hereunder and that, except as required under applicable law, no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately notify Generate or the applicable Distributor of any change in your billing address or Payment Information. Generate reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Services or by email delivery to you. Without limiting anything set forth therein, you acknowledge and agree that we may provide your Payment Information to our third party service providers (e.g., our payment processing partner) for use pursuant to our Privacy Policy.

        <p>
        5.3 Subscription. The fee for a Subscription will be billed by the Distributor or Generate at the start of your Subscription or, if applicable, at the end of any free trial period, and at regular intervals in accordance with your elections at the time of purchase. The timing of billing may change at any time. Your Subscription will continue to automatically renew indefinitely, including if you terminate your Account, until your Subscription is canceled in accordance with the Agreement. After your initial Subscription period, and again after any subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically renew on the first day following the end of such period (each a “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period at Generate’s then-current price for such Subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature (even if you otherwise terminate your Account) unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the Renewal Commencement Date in accordance with any terms between you and the Distributor. You may opt out of the auto-renewal of your Subscription, or cancel your Subscription, in the manner described at the link here. If you cancel your Subscription, such cancellation will be effective as of the end of your then-current Subscription term (the “Cancellation Date”), and your Subscription will not be renewed after such then-current term. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund from Generate of any portion of the fees paid for the then current period of your Subscription. By purchasing a Subscription, you authorize the applicable Distributor or Generate to charge your Payment Information in accordance with your selected Subscription plan. Upon renewal of your Subscription, if the applicable Distributor or Generate does not receive payment via your Payment Information, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand and/or (b) you agree that Distributor or Generate may either cancel or suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Information until payment is received.

        <p>
        5.4 Free Trials. Certain Subscription offerings may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method, the period of which will be communicated to you via the Services. If you decide to cancel your Subscription before Generate starts charging your payment method, you must cancel the Subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you will be responsible for payment for the full term of the Subscription period.
        </p>
        <p>
        5.5 No Refunds. Generate does not issue any refunds for any products or services purchased on or through the services and we are not obligated to provide any credits for partial use periods.
        </p>
        <p>
        5.6 Payment Service Provider. All financial transactions made in connection with the Services will be processed by the Distributor or their third party payment service provider in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and/or any applicable payment terms and conditions. As such, in no event will Generate be responsible for the actions or inactions of any Distributor or their third party payment service provider, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages, and any billing and fee disputes may require resolution between you and the Distributor or applicable third party. If you notify us of any fee or billing dispute we will likely direct you to the Distributor to address such dispute, but, to the extent we are able, we may assist you in resolving such dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
        5.7 Taxes. The payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement do not include any Sales Tax that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. If Generate determines it has a legal obligation to collect a Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, Generate shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the payments required under Section 5.1 of this Agreement. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Generate, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Generate for any liability or expense Generate may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Generate’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
        </p>
        <h4>
        Summary: The above sections provide information about our payment and subscription terms. If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew unless and until it is cancelled by you as described here. If you close your Generate account, you must separately cancel your subscription.

        <p>10.2 Termination of Services by Generate. Generate may terminate this Agreement or your ability to access or use any or all Services at any time for any reason, including if timely payment cannot be charged to your Payment Information for any reason, if you have breached any provision of the Agreement, or if Generate is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services are, or becomes, unlawful).

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>11. ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW.</h2>

        <p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with Generate and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.

        <p>11.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with Generate, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in court if your claims qualify; and (b) you or Generate may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>

        <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>11.3 Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to: (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Generate. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>

        <p>11.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND Generate HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Generate are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 11.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>

        <p>11.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the Provincial or Federal Courts located in the Province of British Columbia and Country of Canada. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>

        <p>11.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: opt-out@Generateapp.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Generate username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>

        <p>11.7 Severability. Except as provided in subsection 11.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <p>11.8 Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Generate.</p>

        <p>11.9 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Generate makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Generate at the following address: Suite 1600 Cathedral Place. 925 West Georgia Street. Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3L2</p>

        <h4>Summary: This section describes how claims that you and we have against each other are resolved, including any claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this agreement. In particular, it requires disputes between us to be submitted to binding and final arbitration. Unless you opt out of the arbitration agreement, you will only be able to pursue claims and seek relief against us on an individual basis and you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial.</h4>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>12.7 Notice. Where Generate requires that you provide an email address, you are responsible for providing Generate with your most current email address. In the event that the last email address you provided to Generate is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by the Agreement, Generate’s dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice. You may give notice to Generate at the following address: 1500 Broadway, Attn: Legal,  Suite 1600 Cathedral Place. 925 West Georgia Street. Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3L2.
