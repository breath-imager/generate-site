        <h2>SUBSCRIPTION/FEE BASED SERVICES</h2>
        </p>

        <p>
          Certain of the Services made available on the Sites, such as purchasing merchandise through our online store, require the use of your payment information (a “Pay Service”). Should you choose to purchase a Pay Service, you agree to pay all
          the
          fees applicable for such Pay Service that are incurred through your account or otherwise by you plus all applicable taxes (the “Fees”). All Fees are non-refundable subject to applicable law.

          without limitation, where GENERATE has determined, in its sole discretion, that your use of the Pay Service is, or was, in breach of these Terms and Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, any coupons or credits purchased in connection with
          any Pay Service are not and shall not be deemed to be gift cards pursuant to the definition of “gift cards” under any legislation (municipal, provincial, federal or other) or otherwise. Any such termination by GENERATE shall be in addition
          to
